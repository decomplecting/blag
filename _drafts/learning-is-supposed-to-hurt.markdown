I was just on Twitter and had occasion to mention the pain of learning. It
started simply enough, an offhand reference to _Battlestar Galactica:_

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I want the pain, it&#39;s how I learn. I was instrumental in the destruction of humanity, but... I learned because... I fell in love&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lrnchat?src=hash">#lrnchat</a></p>&mdash; jason (@canweriotnow) <a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow/status/647220698541346818">September 25, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A few tweets back and forth with book recommendations... _The Art of War,_
_The War of Art,_ _Against Happiness,_ _Go No Rin Sho,_ and so on...

But then I thought about the moments I truly learned, and the best moments of my
work, when I learn something so profoundly shattering that it changes the way
I think...

## Happy Pain

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That sad truth is, is that true learning hurts, but it&#39;s a happy pain. Education replaces happy pain with pure misery. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lrnchat?src=hash">#lrnchat</a></p>&mdash; jason (@canweriotnow) <a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow/status/647223122425479168">September 25, 2015</a></blockquote>

This "happy pain" is something I feel on my _best days_ working as a programmer.
In fact, as masochistic as it might seem, I miss this feeling on the days I'm
doing something I've done 100 times or more.

Maybe that's technically masochism, but I don't think so; if I were a masochist
I guess I'd program in PHP or C++.

Or maybe not.

There is a difference between pain and misery, between acute and chronic.

In the body, acute pain causes the release of a flood of endorphins, hence
the "high" we get from eating hot peppers or intense exercise; chronic pain
exhausts the body's supply of endorphins, and we simply suffer.

This, I think, highlights the disjuncture between learning and education,
between the feeling I get when stretching my coding ability to the limit and
reading the docs for another stupid XML API, between C++ and Lisp.

## Math is...

I have a great love for teachers. I'm too lazy to grep for previous posts, but
it's there if you want to search for my previous posts. My mom is (well, now
retired) a fantastic teacher. I grew up in a great school district with some
of the best schools around which makes the next part all the more tragic:

# Math education in this country is execrable.
# No, just excrement.

How the actual **fuck** do we think we're supposed to "fix" STEM education
in this country when a privileged little white fuck like me had to fight
tooth and claw against a well-funded, tech-savvy (by comparison) school
system not to detest and avoid something as beautiful and fundamental
as mathematics?

The mind fucking boggles.
