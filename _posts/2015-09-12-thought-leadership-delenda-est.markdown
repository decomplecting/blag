There is a short list of terms that have entered the vernacular, in the tech
world and _a fortiori_ in the startup world, which I detest. I can think of
no better term to express my emotion at these terms, for I consider them
beneath contempt and an assault on dignity. One, as I have mentioned, is
_"human capital"_ - a term so offensive I can't even.

Another, however, is the term _"thought leader"_ - a term I hate for reasons
practical, political, and philosophical. And those reasons are not easily divided.

For one, the term "thought leader" is much like the Satrean on Levinasian Other:
it contains what it cannot possibly contain. Moreover, it has all the properties
of Baudrillard's simulacrum, and this is the pity.

Coming from an anarchist (properly, anarcho-syndicalist or anarchist-communist)
political background, I am a great believe in the leadership of ideas rather
than hte leadership of men (or humans of any gender identity). Thus, the idea of
"thought leadership" is _prima facie_ appealing, until we recognize it for what
it is: it is the crowning of individuals who are - and let's not deceive
ourselves - experts in their areas - as demagogues. The leadership of ideas is
one thing - the anointing of demagogues is quite another; in fact, precisely
what the notion of the leadership of ideas intended to eradicate.

And this brings me to Baudrillard and the notion of simulation and simulacra:
Baudrillard defines the simulacrum as _the lie that has absorbed all of the energy of the truth._

Well, he defines it many times in many places; it's tough to nail down. Rather
like Lacan's _objet petit a_ in this regard... whatever you can say it is,
it's not that.

But this isn't a psychoanalytic seminar, so let's leave that in parentheses for
the moment.

The concept of a "thought leader" - what we just once called an "expert" - is a lie of
demagoguery that has absorbed all the truth of the "leadership of ideas".
It is the modern method of making gods out of men, sapping our humility
and our subservience to the ideas that should indeed lead us.

Like a vampire in the Gothic tales, the idea of the "thought leader" has sucked
dry our belief in ideas and placed our faith back in men.
This we cannot allow. The only thing to do with a "thought leader" is kill it.

I make a lot of jokes about "thought leader" is the title you get when you have
no actual marketable skills, but there is no joking here.

Much like Carthage... "thought leadership" delenda est.
