Lately I've been focusing on the management aspects of my role at
[Yet Analytics][yet] because I'm the first to admit I'm generally better
at dealing with machines than people. But I've found some sound guidance along
the way, whether it's Chad Fowler's personal career advice in
_[The Passionate Programmer][tpp],_ or the managerial advice on building
software teams in _[Managing The Unmanageable][mtu]._

And although there's been a lot of whinging about the emphasis on "passion"
as a cipher for "unpaid overtime" or Github contributions as unpaid labor
cum job requirement...

I was reading all these books and this line from Kerouac's _On The Road_
lept out at me as describing exactly the developers I want to work with.
Not just hire, mind you, but the developers I want to recruit because
I want to surround myself with people who will challenge me to be better as
well:

{% quote author:"Jack Kerouac" title:"On The Road" %}

They danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I shambled after as I've
been doing all my life after people who interest me, because the only people for
me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved,
desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn or say a
commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles
exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue
centerlight pop and everybody goes "Awww!"

{% endquote %}

I don't know, maybe that's absurd, maybe it's expecting too much.

But if I wasn't after that fire, I wouldn't be doing what I am.
