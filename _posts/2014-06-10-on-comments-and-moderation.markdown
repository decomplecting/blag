I've always taken a hands-off approach to moderating comments, feeling that it was a form of censorship to restrict discussion even on my own blog. It's worked pretty well; I feel like prior to yesterday, I've deleted less than three comments in the three years I've maintained this blog.

But yesterday's post, [I'm Telling :: Employer-Tattling and The Decline of Agency](http://decomplecting.org/blog/2014/06/09/im-telling/), brought in some of the nastiest of trolls, and I had to re-evaluate that policy. The post also got so many comments I was going crazy trying to weigh my anti-censorship views against comments that bordered on hate speech.

I even asked Twitter for advice:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Twitter, I need advice about when it&#39;s appropriate to moderate blog comments.

I got a number of suggestions:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/canweriotnow">@canweriotnow</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ckaratnytsky">@ckaratnytsky</a> If it is libellous, slanderous, threatening, or grossly offensive, then have at it.</p>&mdash; Khaled Z (@der_bluthund) <a href="https://twitter.com/der_bluthund/statuses/476165033773514752">June 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

I don't think I want to disable comments completely. But as [@lastwheel](https://twitter.com/lastwheel) suggests, there are plenty of other places for people to converse. In fact, the [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7869644) for the post mentioned above had some pretty great (as well as pretty terrible, but hey, it's HN) replies. Plenty of blogs I read even post links to HN and Reddit threads in lieu of on-site comments.

### The plan

So here's what I'm going to do, as an experiment. Comments will remain open for 24-48 hours on the post. After that, I'm closing the thread, and you can take it to [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com), [Reddit](http://reddit.com), or wherever else the post ends up. Ths way there's ample time for discussion, but I don't have to worry about spending my life moderating comments. Hell, I rarely have time for blogging in the first place lately.

If you have any other suggestions... Look, comments!
